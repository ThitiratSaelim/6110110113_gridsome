## Plot Synopsis

> "Hotel del Luna" (previously known as Guest House of the Moon) is not like any other hotel. A supernatural place, the hotel is not visible in its true form during the daytime as humans can only come across the hotel under special circumstances. Its staff and clients are all souls/ghosts coming to terms with unfinished business in their former lives before they pass on to the afterlife and cycle of reincarnation; the staff in particular have been there for decades and even centuries as they have not settled their grudges. The exception to this is the hotel general manager, which has been filled by a succession of human "passersby" since they need to interact normally with the real world in instances like paying bills or fulfilling ghosts' requests with still-living relatives/friends. Some of the more powerful or long-lasting ghosts can make themselves present among humans but they have to abide by the guidelines of the deities Mago and Grim Reaper; for instance killing a human being will usually result in the soul being destroyed without going on to the afterlife. Ghosts can see other ghosts and humans, however only a select few humans such as the Guest House of the Moon manager can see ghosts.
